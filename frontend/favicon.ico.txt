To create a proper favicon.ico file for SafetyNet:

1. Create a 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixel image with your desired SafetyNet icon
   - Consider using a shield icon, police badge, or safety symbol
   - Use colors that match your application theme (blues, etc.)

2. Convert your image to .ico format using:
   - Online converters like favicon.io, convertio.co, or ezgif.com
   - Graphics software like GIMP or Photoshop

3. Save the file as "favicon.ico" in the frontend directory

4. Replace this text file with the actual favicon.ico file

Your favicon will then be served automatically by the route I've added to app.py
