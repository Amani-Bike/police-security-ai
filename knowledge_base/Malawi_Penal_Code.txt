CHAPTER III
TERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF THIS CODE
[Ch0701s5]5. Offence committed partly within and partly beyond the jurisdiction
When an act which, if wholly done within the jurisdiction of the court, would be an offence
against this Code, is done partly within and partly beyond the jurisdiction, every person who within the
jurisdiction does or makes any part of such act may be tried and punished under this Code in the same
manner as if such act had been done wholly within the jurisdiction.
[Ch0701s6]6. Jurisdiction and procedure in respect of certain offences committed in countries outside
Malawi
(1) Any Malawi citizen being a person employed in the public service of Malawi who commits, in
any other country, when acting or purporting to act in the course of his employment, any offence which,

and subject to the same punishment, as if the offence had been committed in Malawi.
(2) A person may be proceeded against, charged, tried and punished for an offence against this
section in any place in Malawi in which he is apprehended or is in custody as if the offence had been
committed in that place; and the offence shall, for all purposes incidental to or consequential on the
trial or punishment thereof, be deemed to have been committed in that place.
CHAPTER IV
GENERAL RULES AS TO CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY
[Ch0701s7]7. Ignorance of law
Ignorance of the law does not afford any excuse for any act or omission which would otherwise
constitute an offence unless knowledge of the law by the offender is expressly declared to be an
element of the offence.
[Ch0701s8]8. Bona fide claim of right
A person is not criminally responsible in respect of an offence relating to property, if the act
done or omitted to be done by him with respect to the property was done in the exercise of an honest
claim of right and without intention to defraud.
[Ch0701s9]9. Intention: motive
Subject to the express provisions of this Code relating to negligent acts and omissions, a person
is not criminally responsible for an act or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his will,
or for an event which occurs by accident.
Unless the intention to cause a particular result is expressly declared to be an element of the
offence constituted, in whole or part, by an act or omission, the result intended to be caused by an act
or omission is immaterial.
Unless otherwise expressly declared, the motive by which a person is induced to do or omit to
do an act, or to form an intention, is immaterial so far as regards criminal responsibility.
[Ch0701s10]10. Mistake of fact
A person who does or omits to do an act under an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief
in the existence of any state of things is not criminally responsible for the act or omission to any greater
extent than if the real state of things had been such as he believed to exist.
The operation of this rule may be excluded by the express or implied provisions of the law
relating to the subject.
[Ch0701s11]11. Presumption of sanity
Every person is presumed to be of sound mind, and to have been of sound mind at any time
which comes in question, until the contrary is proved.
[Ch0701s12]12. Insanity
A person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission if at the time of doing the act or
making the omission he is through any disease affecting his mind incapable of understanding what he is
doing, or of knowing that he ought not to do the act or make the omission.
But a person may be criminally responsible for an act or omission, although his mind is affected
by disease, if such disease does not in fact produce upon his mind one or other of the effects above
mentioned in reference to that act or omission.
[Ch0701s13]13. Intoxication
(1) Save as provided in this section, intoxication shall not constitute a defence to any criminal
charge.
(2) Intoxication shall be a defence to any criminal charge if by reason thereof the person charged
at the time of the act or omission complained of did not know that such act or omission was wrong or
did not know what he was doing, and—
(a) the state of intoxication was caused without his consent by the malicious or negligent
act of another person; or
(b) the person charged was by reason of intoxication insane, temporarily or otherwise, at
the time of such act or omission.
(3) Where the defence under the preceding subsection is established, then in a case falling
under paragraph (a) thereof the accused person shall be discharged, and in a case falling under
paragraph (b) the provisions of section 12 shall apply.
(4) Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the person
charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he would not be guilty
of the offence.
(5) For the purposes of this section “intoxication” shall be deemed to include a state produced
by narcotics or drugs.
[Ch0701s14]14. Immature age
A person under the age of seven years is not criminally responsible for any act or omission.
A person under the age of twelve years is not criminally responsible for an act or omission
unless it is proved that at the time of doing the act or making the omission he had capacity to know that
he ought not to do the act or make the omission.
A male person under the age of twelve years is presumed to be incapable of having carnal
knowledge.
[Ch0701s15]15. Judicial officers
Except as expressly provided by this Code, a judicial officer is not criminally responsible for
anything done or omitted to be done by him in the exercise of his judicial functions, although the act
done is in excess of his judicial authority or although he is bound to do the act omitted to be done.
[Ch0701s16]16. Compulsion
A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if it is committed by two or more offenders,
and if the act is done or omitted only because during the whole of the time in which it is being done or
omitted the person is compelled to do or omit to do the act by threats on the part of the other offender
or offenders instantly to kill him or do him grievous bodily harm if he refuses; but threats of future injury
do not excuse any offence.
[Ch0701s17]17. Defence of person or property
Subject to any express provisions in this Code or any other law in operation in Malawi, criminal
responsibility for the use of force in the defence of person or property shall be determined according to
the principles of English common law.
[Ch0701s18]18. Use of force in effecting arrest
Where any person is charged with a criminal offence arising out of the lawful arrest, or
attempted arrest, by him of a person who forcibly resists such arrest or attempts to evade being
arrested, the court shall, in considering whether the means used were necessary, or the degree of force
used was reasonable, for the apprehension of such person, have regard to the gravity of the offence
which had been or was being committed by such person and the circumstances in which such offence
had been or was being committed by such person.
[Ch0701s19]19. Compulsion by husband
A married woman is not free from criminal responsibility for doing or omitting to do an act
merely because the act or omission takes place in the presence of her husband; but on a charge against
a wife for any offence other than treason or murder it shall be a good defence to prove that the offence
was committed in the presence of, and under the coercion of, the husband.
[Ch0701s20]20. Person not to be punished twice for the same offence
A person shall not be punished twice, either under the provisions of this Code or under the
provisions of any other law, for the same offence.
CHAPTER V
PARTIES TO OFFENCES
[Ch0701s21]21. Principal offenders
When an offence is committed, each of the following persons is deemed to have taken part in
committing the offence and to be guilty of the offence, and may be charged with actually committing it,
that is to say—
(a) every person who actually does the act or makes the omission which constitutes the
offence;
(b) every person who does or omits to do any act for the purpose of enabling or aiding
another person to commit the offence;
(c) every person who aids or abets another person in committing the offence; and
(d) any person who counsels or procures any other person to commit the offence.
In the fourth case he may be charged with himself committing the offence or with counselling or
procuring its commission.
A conviction of counselling or procuring the commission of an offence entails the same
consequences in all respects as a conviction of committing the offence.
Any person who procures another to do or omit to do any act of such a nature that if he had
himself done the act or made the omission the act or omission would have constituted an offence on his
part, is guilty of an offence of the same kind, and is liable to the same punishment, as if he had himself
done the act or made the omission; and he may be charged with himself doing the act or making the
omission.
[Ch0701s22]22. Offences committed by joint offenders in prosecution of common purpose
When two or more persons form a common intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose in
conjunction with one another, and in the prosecution of such purpose an offence is committed of such a
nature that its commission was a probable consequence of the prosecution of such purpose, each of
them is deemed to have committed the offence.
[Ch0701s23]23. Counselling another to commit an offence
When such a person counsels another to commit an offence, and an offence is actually
committed after such counsel by the person to whom it is given, it is immaterial whether the offence
actually committed is the same as that counselled or a different one, or whether the offence is
committed in the way counselled or in a different way, provided in either case that the facts constituting
the offence actually committed are a probable consequence of carrying out the counsel.
In either case the person who gave counsel is deemed to have counselled the other person to
commit the offence actually committed by him.
[Ch0701s24]24. Offences by corporations, societies etc.
Where an offence is committed by any company or other body corporate, or by any society,
association or body of persons, every person charged with or concerned or acting in, the control or
management of the affairs or activities of such company, body corporate, society, association or body of
persons shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be punished accordingly, unless it is proved
by such person that, through no act or omission on his part, he was not aware that the offence was
being or was intended or about to be committed, or that he took all reasonable steps to prevent its
commission.

pleasure, and if so sentenced he shall be liable to be detained in such place and under such conditions as
the President may direct, and whilst so detained shall be deemed to be in legal custody.

of corporal punishment intervene and prohibit the remainder of the sentence from being carried out, if

in its discretion either remit such sentence or pass upon such person any sentence to which he might
have been liable.
(7) An offender sentenced to undergo corporal punishment may be detained in a prison or some
other convenient place for such time as may be necessary for carrying the sentence into effect, or for
ascertaining whether the same shall be carried into effect.

in writing it considers it necessary to do so.

the offence, or, if such property cannot be forfeited or cannot be found, of such sum as the court shall
assess as the value of the property; and any property or sum so forfeited shall be dealt with in such
manner as the Minister may direct. Payment of any sum so ordered to be forfeited may be enforced in

the subsequent conviction, shall be executed after the expiration of the former sentence, unless the
court directs that it shall be executed concurrently with the former sentence or of any part thereof:

CHAPTER XVIII
DEFAMATION
[Ch0701s200]200. Definition of libel
Any person who, by print, writing, painting, effigy, or by any means otherwise than solely by
gestures, spoken words, or other sounds, unlawfully publishes any defamatory matter concerning
another person, with intent to defame that other person, shall be guilty of the misdemeanour termed
“libel".
[Ch0701s201]201. Definition of defamatory matter
Defamatory matter is matter likely to injure the reputation of any person by exposing him to
hatred, contempt or ridicule, or likely to damage any person in his profession or trade by an injury to his
reputation. It is immaterial whether at the time of the publication of the defamatory matter the person
concerning whom such matter is published is living or dead:
Provided that no prosecution for the publication of defamatory matter concerning a dead
person shall be instituted without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
[Ch0701s202]202. Definition of publication
(1) A person publishes a libel if he causes the print, writing, painting, effigy or other means by
which the defamatory matter is conveyed to be so dealt with, either by exhibition, reading, recitation,
description, delivery, or otherwise, as that the defamatory meaning thereof becomes known or is likely
to become known to either the person defamed or any other person.
(2) It is not necessary for libel that a defamatory meaning should be directly or completely
expressed; and it suffices if such meaning and its application to the person alleged to be defamed can be
collected either from the alleged libel itself or from any extrinsic circumstances, or partly by the one and
partly by the other means.
[Ch0701s203]203. Definition of unlawful publication
Any publication of defamatory matter concerning a person is unlawful within the meaning of
this Chapter, unless (a) the matter is true and it was for the public benefit that it should be published or
(b) it is privileged on one of the grounds hereafter mentioned in this Chapter.
[Ch0701s204]204. Cases in which publication of defamatory matter is absolutely privileged
(1) The publication of defamatory matter is absolutely privileged, and no person shall under any
circumstances be liable to punishment under this Code in respect thereof, in any of the following cases,
namely—
(a) if the matter is published by the President, or by the Cabinet or the National Assembly,
in any official document or proceeding; or
(b) if the matter is published in the Cabinet or the National Assembly by any member of
such bodies; or
(c) if the matter is published by order of the President; or
(d) if the matter is published concerning a person subject to military or naval discipline for
the time being, and relates to his conduct as a person subject to such discipline, and is published by
some person having authority over him in respect of such conduct, and to some person having authority
over him in respect of such conduct; or
(e) if the matter is published in the course of any judicial proceedings by a person taking
part therein as a judge or magistrate or commissioner or legal practitioner or juror or assessor or
witness or party thereto; or
(f) if the matter published is in fact a fair report of anything said, done, or published in the
Cabinet or National Assembly; or
(g) if the person publishing the matter is legally bound to publish it.
(2) Where a publication is absolutely privileged, it is immaterial for the purposes of this Chapter
whether the matter be true or false, and whether it be or be not known or believed to be false, and
whether it be or be not published in good faith:
Provided that nothing in this section shall exempt a person from any liability to punishment
under any other Chapter of this Code or under any other Act in force within the Republic.
[Ch0701s205]205. Cases in which publication of defamatory matter is conditionally privileged
A publication of defamatory matter is privileged, on condition that it was published in good
faith, if the relation between the parties by and to whom the publication is made is such that the person
publishing the matter is under some legal, moral or social duty to publish it to the person to whom the
publication is made or has a legitimate personal interest in so publishing it,provided that the publication
does not exceed either in extent or matter what is reasonably sufficient for the occasion, and in any of
the following cases, namely—
(a) if the matter published is in fact a fair report of anything said, done, or shown in a civil
or criminal inquiry or proceeding before any court:
Provided that if the court prohibits the publication of anything said or shown before it,
on the ground that it is seditious, immoral, or blasphemous, the publication thereof shall not be
privileged; or
(b) if the matter published is a copy or reproduction, or in fact a fair abstract, of any matter
which has been previously published, and the previous publication of which was or would have been
privileged under the last preceding section; or
(c) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the conduct of a person in a
judicial, official, or other public capacity or as to his personal character so far as it appears in such
conduct; or
(d) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the conduct of a person in
relation to any public question or matter, or as to his personal character so far as it appears in such
conduct; or
(e) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the conduct of any person as
disclosed by evidence given in a public legal proceeding, whether civil or criminal, or as to the conduct of
any person as a party, witness, or otherwise in any such proceeding, or as to the character of any person
so far as it appears in any such conduct as in this paragraph mentioned; or
(f) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the merits of any book,
writing, painting, speech, or other work, performance, or act published, or publicly done or made, or
submitted by a person to the judgment of the public, or as to the character of the person so far as it
appears therein; or
(g) if the matter is a censure passed by a person in good faith on the conduct of another
person in any matter in respect of which he has authority, by contract or otherwise, over the other
person, or on the character of the other person, so far as it appears in such conduct; or
(h) if the matter is a complaint or accusation made by a person in good faith against
another person in respect of his conduct in any matter, or in respect of his character so far as it appears
in such conduct, to any person having authority, by contract or otherwise, over that other person in
respect of such conduct or matter, or having authority by law to inquire into or receive complaints
respecting such conduct or matter; or
(i) if the matter is published in good faith for the protection of the rights or interests of the
person who publishes it, or of the person to whom it is published, or of some person in whom the
person to whom it is published is interested.
[Ch0701s206]206. Explanation as to good faith
A publication of defamatory matter shall not be deemed to have been made in good faith by a
person, within the meaning of the last preceding section if it is made to appear either—
(a) that the matter was untrue, and that he did not believe it to be true; or
(b) that the matter was untrue, and that he published it without having taken reasonable
care to ascertain whether it was true or false; or
(c) that in publishing the matter, he acted with intent to injure the person defamed in a
substantially greater degree or substantially otherwise than was reasonably necessary for the interest of
the public or for the protection of the private right or interest in respect of which he claims to be
privileged.
[Ch0701s207]207. Presumption as to good faith
If it is proved, on behalf of the accused person, that the defamatory matter was published under
such circumstances that the publication would have been justified if made in good faith, the publication
shall be presumed to have been made in good faith until the contrary is made to appear, either from the
libel itself, or from the evidence given on behalf of the accused person, or from evidence given on the
part of the prosecution.
Division IV
Offences against the Person
CHAPTER XIX
MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER
[Ch0701s208]208. Manslaughter
Any person who by an unlawful act or omission causes the death of another person shall be
guilty of the felony termed “manslaughter”. An unlawful omission is an omission amounting to culpable
negligence to discharge a duty tending to the preservation of life or health, whether such omission is or
is not accompanied by an intention to cause death or bodily harm.
[Ch0701s209]209. Murder
Any person who of malice aforethought causes the death of another person by an unlawful act
or omission shall be guilty of murder.
[Ch0701s210]210. Punishment of murder
Any person convicted of murder shall be sentenced to death.
[Ch0701s211]211. Punishment of manslaughter
Any person who commits the felony of manslaughter shall be liable to imprisonment for life.
[Ch0701s212]212. Malice aforethought
Malice aforethought shall be deemed to be established by evidence proving any one or more of
the following circumstances—
(a) an intention to cause the death of or to do grievous harm to any person, whether such
person is the person actually killed or not;
(b) knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably cause the death of or
grievous harm to some person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not, although such
knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or
by a wish that it may not be caused;
(c) an intent to commit a felony;
(d) an intention by the act or omission to facilitate the flight or escape from custody of any
person who has committed or attempted to commit a felony.
[Ch0701s213]213. Killing on provocation
(1) When a person who unlawfully kills another under circumstances which, but for this section,
would constitute murder, does the act which causes death in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation as hereinafter defined, and before there is time for his passion to cool, he is guilty of
manslaughter only.
(2) This section shall not apply unless the court is satisfied that the act which causes death bears
a reasonable relationship to the provocation.
[Ch0701s214]214. Provocation defined
The term “provocation” means and includes, except as hereinafter stated, any wrongful act or
insult of such a nature as to be likely, when done or offered to an ordinary person, or in the presence of
an ordinary person to another person who is under his immediate care, or to whom he stands in a
conjugal, parental, filial, or fraternal relation, or in the relation of master and servant, to deprive him of
the power of self-control and to induce him to assault the person by whom the act or insult is done or
offered.
When such an act or insult is done or offered by one person to another, or in the presence of
another to a person who is under the immediate care of that other, or to whom the latter stands in any
such relation as aforesaid, the former is said to give to the latter provocation for an assault.
A lawful act is not provocation to any person for an assault.
An act which a person does in consequence of incitement given by another person in order to
induce him to do the act and thereby to furnish an excuse for committing an assault is not provocation
to that other person for an assault.
An arrest which is unlawful is not necessarily provocation for an assault, but it may be evidence
of provocation to a person who knows of the illegality.
For the purposes of this section the expression “an ordinary person” shall mean an ordinary
person of the community to which the accused belongs.
[Ch0701s215]215. Causing death defined
A person is deemed to have caused the death of another person although his act is not the
immediate or not the sole cause of death in any of the following cases—
(a) if he inflicts bodily injury on another person in consequence of which that other person
undergoes surgical or medical treatment which causes death. In this case it is immaterial whether the
treatment was proper or mistaken, if it was employed in good faith and with common knowledge and
skill; but the person inflicting the injury is not deemed to have caused the death if the treatment which
was its immediate cause was not employed in good faith or was so employed without common
knowledge or skill;
23 of 1970(b) if he inflicts a bodily injury on another which would not have caused death if the
injured person had submitted to proper surgical or medical treatment or had observed proper
precautions as to his mode of living;
(c) if by actual or threatened violence he causes such other person to perform an act which
causes the death of such person, such act being a means of avoiding such violence which in the
circumstances would appear natural to the person whose death is so caused;
(d) if by any act or omission he hastened the death of a person suffering under any disease
or injury which apart from such act or omission would have caused death;
(e) if his act or omission would not have caused death unless it had been accompanied by
an act or omission of the person killed or of other persons.
[Ch0701s216]216. When child deemed to be a person capable of being killed
A child becomes a person capable of being killed when it has completely proceeded in a living
state from the body of its mother, whether it has breathed or not, and whether it has an independent
circulation or not, and whether the navel-string is severed or not.
[Ch0701s217]217.

surgical or medical treatment to any other person, or to do any other lawful act which is or may be

and he is held to have caused any consequences which result to the life or health of any person by
reason of any omission to observe or perform that duty.
[Ch0701s222]222. Duty of persons in charge of dangerous things
It is the duty of every person who has in his charge or under his control anything, whether living

precaution in its use or management, the life, safety, or health of any person may be endangered, to use
reasonable care and take reasonable precautions to avoid such danger; and he is held to have caused
any consequences which result to the life or health of any person by reason of any omission to perform
that duty.

the age of twelve months, but at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed
by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the
effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child, then, notwithstanding that the circumstances
were such that but for this section the offence would have amounted to murder, she shall be guilty of
felony, to wit of infanticide, and may for such offence be dealt with and punished as if she had been
guilty of the offence of manslaughter of the child.
[Ch0701s231]231. Killing unborn child

being born alive by any act or omission of such a nature that, if the child had been born alive and had

of the proceeds of such security or of such mortgage, pledge, or other disposition, shall be applied to
